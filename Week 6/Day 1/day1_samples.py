# Types of Features: Categorical, Numerical, Ordinal
#
# Categorical Features
#   - Represent discrete categories or labels
#       - One-Hot Encoding
#       - Label Encoding
#
# Numerical Features
#   - Represent continuous or discrete numbers
#   - Preprocessing Techniques
#       - Scaling
#
# Ordinal Features
#   - Represents categorical data with a meaningful order
#   - Encoding techniques
#       - Ordinal


# Overview of Feature Engineering Techniques
#
# Scaling
#   - Ensures all features contribute equally to the model
#   - Techniques: Min-Max Scaling | Standardization
#
# Encoding
#   - Converts categorical data into numerical format
#   - Techniques: One-Hot Encoding | Label Encoding
#
# Transformation
#   - Applies mathematical functions to modify features
#   - Examples: Log Transformation | Polynomial Features
#
# Feature Selection
#   - Reduces the number of input features to improve model performance
#   - Techniques: Statistical Methods | Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
