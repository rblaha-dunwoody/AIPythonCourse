# What is Machine Learning?

# A subset of AI that focuses on building systems that learn from data and improve performance over time without explicit programming
# Instead of rules being written explicitly, they are inferred from patterns in the data

# Real World Applications:
#   - Healthcare: Predicting disease from patient data, cancer detection, etc
#   - Finance: Fraud detection, credit scoring, stock market projections
#   - Autonomous Vehicles: Anomolous detection
#   - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Chat bots


# Types of Machine Learning
#   - Supervised Learning
#       - Model is trained on labeled data
#       - Models learn to map inputs (features) to outputs (targets)
#       - Key Features:
#           - Requires labeled data
#           - Accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the training data
#
#   - Unsupervised Learning
#       - Model works on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures
#       - Examples: Clustering | Dimensionality Reduction
#       - Key Features:
#           - No labeled data is needed
#           - Focused on exploratory analysis and discovering patterns
#
#   - Reinforcement Learning
#       - An agent interacts with an environment and learns by trial and error to maximize cumulative rewards
#       - Examples: Robotics | Gaming | Dynamic Systems
#       - Key Features:
#           - Goal-oriented learning based on rewards and penalties
#           - Suitable for sequential decision-making problems


# Key Concepts of Machine Learning
#   - Features
#       - The input variables (independent variables) used to train the model
#       - Example: In predicting house prices, features could include the number of bedrooms, square footage or location
#   - Target
#       - The output variable (dependent variable) the model predicts
#       - Example: House price is the target variable
#   - Training and Testing Datasets
#       - The data is split into two subsets: Training Set | Testing Set
#       - A typical split is 80% training and 20% testing
#   - Overfitting
#       - Model learns noise and details in the training data, performing poorly on new data
#       - Model becomes too complex for the dataset
#   - Underfitting
#       - Model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data
#       - Example: Fitting a linear model to non-linear data
#   - Bias-Variance Tradoff
#       - Bias: The error introduced by assuming a simplified model
#       - Variance: Error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small changes in the training data
#       - Goal: Balance bias and variance to achieve optimal performance
