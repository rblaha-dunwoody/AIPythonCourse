# Supervised Learning Mini Project


# Building an End-to-End Supervised Learning Project
#
# Key Steps:
#   Define the Problem
#       - Identify the objective: Regression or Classification
# 
#   Data Preparation
#       - Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#           - Understand the structure of the dataset
#           - Visualize data distributions and relationships
#       - Preprocessing
#           - Handle missing values
#           - Scale features for algorithms like k-NN
#           - Encode categorical variables
#
#   Model Selection
#       - Choose appropriate models based on the problem
#
#   Model Evaluation
#       - Use performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression or Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score for classification
#
#   Comparison
#       - Compare multiple models to identify the best-performing one


# Applying Regression and Classification Models on a Real-World Dataset
#
# Dataset Options
#   Regression Example
#       - Predict house prices using features like square footage, number of rooms, and location
#       - Dataset: California Housing Dataset or any housing dataset
#
#   Classification Example
#       - Classify customer churn based on customer demographics and behavior
#       - Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset


# Evaluating and Comparing Model Performance
#
# Steps
#   - Evaluate models using cross-validation
#   - Generate performance metrics
#   - Summarize findings to identify strengths and weaknesses of each model
