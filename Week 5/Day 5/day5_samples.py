# Model Evaluation Metrics for Regression and Classification

# Model Evaluation for Regression
#   - Regression models predict continuous values and their performance is measured using error metrics
#   - Error Metrics:
#       - Mean Square Error (MSE)
#           - Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values
#           - Sensitive to outliers due to squaring of errors
#       - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
#           - Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
#           - Provides a more interpretable measure but less sensitive to outliers
#       - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
#           - Square root of MSE, providing errors in the same units as the target available
