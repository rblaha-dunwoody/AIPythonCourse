# Overview of Supervised Learning

# Key Characteristics
#   - Labeled Data
#       - Supervised learning requires a dataset with labeled examples
#       - Example: Inputs | Outputs
#   - Objective
#       - Minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output
#   - Types of Supervised Learning
#       - Regression: Predicts continuous outputs
#       - Classification: Predicts discrete outputs
#
# Applications of Supervised Learning
#   - Healthcare
#       - Predicting patient outcomes based on medical data
#   - Finance
#       - Fraud detection in transactions, credit risk assessment
#   - Retail
#       - Personalized product recommendations based on customer behavior
#   - Autonomous Vehicles
#       - Object detection and lane tracking using image classification

# Introduction to Regression Analysis

# Linear Regression
#   - Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variable (x)
#   - Equation of a line: y = B0 + B1*x + e
#       - B0: Intercept of a line (starting point of the slope)
#       - B1: Slope of the line
#       - x: Independent variable
#       - e: Error term representing the different between the observed and predicted values
# 
#   - Steps in linear regression
#       - Fit the model
#       - Predict
#       - Evaluate
#
#   - Applications of Regression Models
#       - Predicting sales, healthcare, real estate

# Cost Function and Optimization in Linear Regression
#   - Linear regression aims to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. This is achieved using a "cost function"
#       - Cost Function
#           - Measures how far the predictions are from the actual values
#           - Most common cost function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
#           - Objective is to minimize cost to find the best-fitting line
#
#   - Optimization with Gradient Descent
#       - Gradient Descent Algorithm
#           - Iteratively updates B0 and B1 to minimize the cost function
#           - Update Rule...
#           - Convergence
#               - Algorithm stops when the updates become very small or a predefined number of iterations is reached
#
#   - Visualizing Optimization
#       - The optimization process can be visualized as finding the lowest point on a cost surface
