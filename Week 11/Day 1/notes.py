# Introduction to Sequence Modeling and RNN's

# Overview of Sequence Modeling
#   What is Sequence Modeling?
#       - Involves predicting or generating outputs based on sequential data
#       - Capture temporal or contextual dependencies
#       - Why is Sequence Modeling Important?
#           - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#               - Tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis depend on understanding sequential relationhips in text
#           - Time-Series Analysis
#               - Sequence models are essential for tasks like stock price reduction, weather forecasting, and sensor data analysis


# Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)
#   What are RNN's?
#       - Specialized neural networks for sequence modeling
#       - They include recurrent connections that allow them to maintain a "memory" of previous inputs
#       - Structure of an RNN
#           - Input Layer
#               - Processes sequential data one step at a time
#           - Hidden Layer
#               - Maintains information about past inputs
#           - Recurrent Connections
#               - Pass hidden states from one time step to the next
#
#   Key Concepts in RNN's:
#       - Hidden States
#           - Represent memory at each time step
#       - Recurrent Connections
#           - Enable information sharing across time steps
#       - Vanishing Gradient Problem
#           - Challenges in training long sequences due to diminishing gradients


# Key Applications of RNN's in Machine Learning
#   Text Generation
#       - Generate new text based on learned patterns
#
#   Language Translation
#       - Convert text from one language to another
#
#   Stock Proce Prediction
#       - Predict future stock prices using historical data
#
#   Speech Recognition
#       - Understand spoken words and phrases
#
#   Video Frame Prediction
#       - Anticipate future frames in video sequences
