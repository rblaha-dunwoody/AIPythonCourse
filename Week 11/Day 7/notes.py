# RNN Project Sentiment Analysis

# Applying RNN, LSTM, and GRU mModels to a Complete Task
#   Project Overview
#       - Choose a task: Sentiment analysis
#           -  Sentiment analysis: Classify text into categories like positive or negative sentiment
#
#       - Use RNN, LSTM, or GRU models to solve the chosen task
#       - Focus on preprocessing, embedding integration, model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning


# Analyzing Model Performance
#   Key Metrics
#       - For Sentiment Analysis
#           - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
#
#   Tuning Hyperparameters
#       - Embedding size
#       - Number of hidden units
#       - Learning rate and optimizer choice
#       - Sequence length and batch size


# Experimenting with Architectures and Techniques
#   Architectural Variations
#       - Single-Layer vs. Multi-Layer RNN's
#       - Bidirectional RNN's for improved context capture
#
#   Preprocessing Techniques
#       - Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
#       - Padding for sequence uniformity
