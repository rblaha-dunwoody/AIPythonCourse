# CNN Project Image Classification on Fashion MNIST or CIFAR-10

# Applying CNN Architecture to a Larger Dataset
#   Why Larger Datasets?
#       - Larger datasets like CIFAR-10 or Fashion MNIST represent more realistic and diverse challenges compared to toy datasets like MNIST
#       - They require deeper architectures, careful regularization, and augmentation for optimal performance


# Experimenting with Architecture, Design, Regularization, and Augmentation
#   Key Techniques to Improve Performance
#       - Architectural Modifications
#           - Add more convolutional layers or change kernel sizes
#           - Use more filters in deeper layers to capture complex features
#
#   Regularization
#       - Apply dropout in dense layers and batch normalization in convolutional layers
#       - Prevent overfitting in deeper models
#
#   Data Augmentation
#       - Use techniques like random flipping, cropping, and rotation to improve generalization


# Analyzing Model Performance and Tuning
#   Evaluation Metrics
#       - Accuracy: Overall classification correctness
#       - Loss: Measures the difference between predictions and ground truth
#       - Confusion Matrix: Highlights misclassified classes for deeper insights
