# Building CNN Architectures with PyTorch

# Building CNN Architectures in PyTorch Using the nn Module
#   Key Steps
#       - Define a Model
#           - Use torch.nn.Module to build CNN layers like convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
# 
#       - Forward Pass
#           - Define how input flows through the layers to produce output
#
#       - Model Summary
#           - Inspect the structure and learnable parameters


# Training and Evaluating CNN's in PyTorch
#   Training
#       - Perform forward and backward passes, calculate loss, and update weights using an optimizer
#
#   Evaluation
#       - Test the model on unseen data and compute metrics like accuracy and loss


# Experimenting with CNN Model Design and Tuning Hyperparameters
#   Experimentation Areas
#       - Layer Depth
#           - Add or remove convolutional and pooling layers to observe the impact
#
#       - Filter Size
#           - Experiment with kernel sizes (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)
#
#       - Learning Rate
#           - Adjust the learning rate to improve convergence speed and accuracy
