# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

# Overview of CNN's and Their Role in Image Processing
#   What are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's)?
#       - Specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images
#       - Particularly effective for image-related tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation
#       - Why CNN's for Image Processing?
#           - Sptial Hierarchies
#               - CNN's captural spatial and hierarchical patterns in images
#               - Convolutional layers extract features like edges, textures and complex structures
#           - Parameter Efficiency
#               - Unlike fully connected networks, CNN's use fewer parameters due to shared weights, reducing computation and memory requirements


# CNN Architecture
#   Key Components of a CNN:
#       - Convolutional Layers
#           - Perform convolution operations to extract features
#           - Kernel/Filter
#               - A small matrix (e.g., 3x3) that slides over the input image to detect patterns
#           - Output
#               - Feature maps highlighting specific patterns in the input
#
#       - Pooling Layers
#           - Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensions and computation
#           - Types
#               - Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value in a region
#               - Average Pooling: Takes the average value in a region
#
#       - Fully Connected Layers
#           - Combine extracted features for final predictions
#           - Act as a "classifier" in the network
#
#   Basic CNN Flow: Input Image -> Convolution -> Activation -> Pooling -> Fully Connected Layer -> Output


# Key Advantages of CNN's Over Fully Connected Networks for Images
#   Translation Invariance
#       - CNN's can detect patterns irrespective of their position in the image
#
#   Reduced Parameters
#       - Shared weights and local connectivity make CNN's computationally efficient
#
#   Automatic Feature Extraction
#       - CNN's learn to identify meaningful patterns like edges, shapes, and textures directly from data
