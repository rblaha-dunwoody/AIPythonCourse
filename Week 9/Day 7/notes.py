# Neural Network Project - Image Classification on CIFAR-10

# Applying Learned Concepts to a More Complex Dataset
#   Why CIFAR-10?
#       - The CIFAR-10 dataset is a challenging benchmark dataset for image classification
#       - Contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (such as airplane, car, bird, dog, etc.)
#       - Unlike MNIST, CIFAR-10 involves more complex patterns and requires robust neural network architectures


# Building and Optimizing a Neural Network for Image Classification
#   Key Steps:
#       - Preprocess the dataset for training (e.g., normalization, one-hot encoding)
#       - Define a neural network with convolutional laers for feature extraction
#       - Optimize the network using techniques like learning rate adjustment and dropout


# Analyzing Model Performance and Experimenting with Hyperparameters
#   Performance Analysis
#       - Evaluate accuracy and loss curves during training
#       - Use test set metrics to measure generalization
#
#   Experimentation
#       - Try different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Tanh)
#       - Test optimizers like SGD, Adam and RMSprop
#       - Adjust the learning rate and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay)
