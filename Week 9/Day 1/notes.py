# Overview of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
#   Structure of a Neural Network
#       - Input Layer
#           - Accepts input data features
#
#       - Hidden Layers
#           - Perform computations to extract patterns
#
#       - Output Layer
#           - Produces predictions or classifications
#
#   Key Components
#       - Neurons
#           - Basic units of computation that take inputs, apply weights and biases, and produce outputs using an activation function
#
#       - Weights and Biases
#           - Weights determine the importance of each input
#           - Bias shifts the output of the activation function
#
#       - Activation Functions
#           - Add non-linearity to the model (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
#
#   How Neural Networks Work
#       - Forward Propagation
#           - Data flows through the network to generate predictions
#
#       - Loss Claculation
#           - Compares predictions with actual labels to compute the error
#
#       - Backpropagation
#           - Adjusts weights and biases using gradient descent to minimize the loss


# Applications of Deep Learning
#   Domains and Use Cases
#       - Computer Vision
#           - Image Classification (e.g., recognizing objects in images)
#           - Object Detection (e.g., autonomous vehicles)
#
#       - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#           - Text generation (e.g., GPT models)
#           - Sentiment analysis
#
#       - Healthcare
#           - Disease diagnosis (e.g., identifying tumors in X-rays)
#           - Drug discovery
#
#       - Speech Processing
#           - Speech-to-text systems (e.g., virtual assistants)
#           - Voice recognition
