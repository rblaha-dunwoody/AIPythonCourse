# Introduction to Hyperparameter Tuning

# Parameters and Hyperparameters
#   What are Parameters?
#       - Values learned by a machine learning model during training
#       - Adjusted to minimize the loss function and optimize predictions
#       - Examples:
#           - Coefficients in Linear Regression
#           - Weights and biases in Neural Networks
#
#   What are Hyperparameters?
#       - Settings defined before training that influence how the model learns from data
#       - Not learned from the data but instead control the training process
#       - Examples:
#           - Tree Depth
#           - Learning Rate
#           - Number of Estimators


# Importance of Tuning Hyperparameters
#   Why Tune Hyperparameters?
#       - Improve Model Performance
#           - Optimal hyperparameters help models generalize better, reducing overfitting and underfitting
#       
#       - Enhance Efficiency
#           - Proper tuning can reduce training time and computational resources
#
#       - Adapt to Problem-Specific Needs
#           - Tailoring hyperparameters ensures the model fits the dataset's characteristics


# Common Hyperparameters in Popular Models
#   Decision Trees and Random Forests
#       - Max Depth: Limits the depth of trees to avoid overfitting
#       - Min Samples Split: Minimum samples required to split an internal node
#       - Number of Estimators: Total number of trees in Random Forest
#
#   Gradient Boosting Models
#       - Learning Rate: Determines the contribution of each tree
#       - Subsample: Fraction of training data used to train each tree
#       - Max Depth: Limits the complexity of individual trees
#
#   Neural Networks
#       - Learning Rate: Step size for weight updates
#       - Number of Layers: Determines the depth of the network
#       - Batch Size: Number of samples per gradient update
