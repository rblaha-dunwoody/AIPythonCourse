# Optimization Project - Building and Tuning a Final Model

# Applying All Learned Tuning and Optimization Techniques
#   Comprehensive Model Optimization
#       - Data Preprocessing:
#           - Ensure data is clean, scaled, and encoded properly
#   
#       - Feature Engineering
#           - Derive new features and select the most important ones
#
#       - Regularization
#           - Avoid overfitting by penalizing complex models
#
#       - Cross-Validation
#           - Use techniques like K-Fold or Stratified K-Fold for robust performance metrics
#
#       - Hyperparameter Tuning
#           - Use methods like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or Bayesian Optimization


# Evaluating and Interpreting Model Performance
#   Performance Metrics
#       - Classification
#           - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
#
#       - Regression
#           - Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R^2
#
#       - Importance of Interpretability
#           - Use feature importance and coefficient analysis for transparency
