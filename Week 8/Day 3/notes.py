# Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning with Bayesian Optimization

# Introduction to Bayesian Optimization
#   What is Bayesian Optimization?
#       - Avanced method for hyperparameter tuning that balances exploration (searching new regions) and exploitation (refining promising regions)
#       - Uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters
#       - How it Works:
#           - Surrogate Model
#               - Builds a probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian Process) of the objective function based on prior evaluations
#           - Acquisition Function
#               - Balances exploration and exploitation by choosing the next hyperparamters to evaluate based on predicted performance and uncertainty
#           - Iterative Refinement
#               - Updates the surrogate model after each evaluation, refining the search
#
#       - Why Use Bayesian Optimization?
#           - Efficient for high-dimensional and expensive-to-evaluate functions
#           - Reduces the number of evaluations requires to find near-optimal hyperparameters


# Using Libraries for Bayesian Optimization
#   Popular Libraries
#       - Hyperopt
#           - Simplifies Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning
#           - Works with fmin to minimize objective functions over a parameter space
#
#       - Optuna
#           - Flexible and user-friendly library for hyperparameter optimization
#           - Supports dynamic search spaces and pruning of unpromising trails


# Understanding Exploration vs. Exploitation
#   Exploration
#       - Focuses on sampling hyperparameters from unexplored regions
#       - Useful for identifying new areas of high potential
#
#   Exploitation
#       - Focuses on refining the search around regions with known high performance
#       - Useful for fine-tuning near-optimal hyperparameters
#
#   Bayesian Optimization's Advantage
#       - Balances these approaches using the acquisition function to minimize unnecessary evaluations while improving results
