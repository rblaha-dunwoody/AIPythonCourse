# Handling Imbalanced Data

# Problems Caused by Imbalanced Data in Classification Tasks
#   What is Imbalanced Data?
#       - Refers to datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the other(s)
#       - Challenges with Imbalanced Data:
#           - Bias Toward Majority Class:
#               - Machine learning models tend to prioritize the majority class due to its frequency
#           - Misleading Evaluation Metrics:
#               - Metrics like accuracy can be misleading, as they do not account for class imbalance
#           - Limited Information for Minority Class
#               - Insufficient samples for the minority class can lead to underfitting
#
#       - Applications with Imbalanced Data
#           - Fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection


# Techniques to Handle Imbalanced Data
#   Resampling Techniques
#       - Oversampling
#           - Increase the number of minority class samples by duplicating or synthesizing new samples
#           - Example: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which generates synthetic examples
#
#       - Undersampling
#           - Reduce the number of majority class samples to balance the dataset
#           - Risk: Loss of valuable information from majority class
#
#   Algorithmic Solutions
#       - Class Weights
#           - Assign higher weights to the minority class during model training
#           - Many algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) have built-in support for class weights
#
#       - Anomaly Detection Models
#           - Treat the minority class as anomalies, focusing the model on detecting them
#
#   Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data
#       - F1 Score
#           - Harmonic mean of precision and recall, focusing on both false positives and false negatives
#
#       - ROC-AUC
#           - Measures the ability to distinguish between classes across various threshold values
#
#       - Precision-Recall Curve
#           - Focuses on performance for the positive class
