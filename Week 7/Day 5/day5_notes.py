# Overview of CatBoost
#   What is CatBoost?
#       - Gradient Boosting library developed specifically to handle categorical features without the need for preprocessing like one-hot encoding
#       - Key Features of CatBoost:
#           - Native Support for Categorical Data
#           - Ordered Boosting
#           - Robust to Overfitting
#
#       - Advantages
#           - Eliminates the need for manual encoding of categorical data
#           - Reduces overfitting with robust boosting techniques
#           - Easy to implement for datasets with many categorical features
#
#       - When to Use CatBoost
#           - Datasets with a high proportion of categorical features
#           - Applications where overfitting is a concern
