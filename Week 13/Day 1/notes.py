# Introduction to Transfer Learning

# What is Transfer Learning?
#   - A machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused as a starting point for another related task
#   - Instead of training a model from scratch, pre-trained models are fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a new task
#   - How it differs from traditional training:

#   | Aspect            | Traditional Training                                  | Transfer Learning                                     |
#   |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
#   | Starting Point    | Train from scratch using random weights               | Start with a pre-trained model                        |
#   | Training Time     | Longer due to the need for basic learning features    | Shorter, as the model has already learned features    |
#   | Dataset Size      | Requires large datasets to perform well               | Can work well on small datasets                       |

# Benefits of Transfer Learning
#   - Reduces Training Time
#       - Pre-trained models already capture foundational features, so fewer epochs are needed
#
#   - Improved Performance on Small Datasets
#       - Transfer learning allows effective training even when data is limited
#
#   - Leverages Generalization
#       - Pre-trained models generalize better across tasks due to exposure to large-scale datasets


# Applications of Transfer Learning
#   - In Computer Vision
#       - Pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, Inception, EfficientNet are used for:
#           - Object detection
#           - Image classification
#           - Image segmentation
#
#   - In NLP
#       - Models like BERT, GPT, T5 are fine-tuned for:
#           - Text classification
#           - Sentiment analysis
#           - Named entity recognition
#           - Question answering
